🏥 OPD Token Allocation System
A dynamic, priority-driven OPD token management system designed for hospitals to efficiently handle patient flow, emergencies, and real-time slot reallocation.

This system supports elastic capacity management, multiple booking sources, and automatic reallocation to ensure optimal doctor utilization and reduced patient wait time.

🚀 Overview
The OPD Token Allocation System intelligently assigns and manages patient tokens across multiple doctors and time slots while handling real-world challenges such as:

Emergency cases

No-shows & cancellations

Slot overflows

Priority patients

Doctor unavailability

The system exposes RESTful APIs and is built to be scalable, fault-tolerant, and real-time ready.

✨ Key Features
🔹 Dynamic Token Allocation
Per-slot hard capacity limits

Emergency overflow support (controlled)

Real-time slot availability tracking

🔹 Multiple Token Sources
Online Booking

Walk-in Patients

Paid Priority Patients

Follow-up Patients

Emergency Cases

🔹 Priority-Based Scheduling
Patients are allocated tokens strictly based on medical and business priority.

🔹 Automatic Reallocation
Handles cancellations and no-shows

Promotes waiting patients automatically

Updates estimated consultation time

🔹 Robust Failure Handling
Graceful API error responses

Capacity validation

Duplicate token prevention

Invalid doctor / slot detection

🧠 Priority Logic
Priority	Type	Description
1️⃣	Emergency	Life-threatening conditions
2️⃣	Paid Priority	Patients who paid for priority
3️⃣	Follow-up	Returning patients
4️⃣	Online Booking	Pre-scheduled appointments
5️⃣	Walk-in	Direct OPD registration
Lower number = Higher Priority

🛠️ API Endpoints
👨‍⚕️ Doctors
Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/api/doctors	Create new doctor
GET	/api/doctors	Fetch all doctors
GET	/api/doctors/:doctorId/schedule	Get doctor schedule
PUT	/api/doctors/:doctorId/slots	Update doctor slots
🎟️ Tokens
Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/api/tokens	Create new token
POST	/api/tokens/emergency	Add emergency token
PUT	/api/tokens/:tokenId/cancel	Cancel token
PUT	/api/tokens/:tokenId/no-show	Mark no-show
GET	/api/tokens/doctor/:doctorId	Tokens by doctor
POST	/api/tokens/reallocate/:doctorId	Reallocate tokens
⚠️ Edge Cases Handled
Emergency insertion into full slots

Reserved emergency capacity per slot

Cancellation chain reaction

No-show auto-reallocation

Doctor unavailability with alternative suggestions

Slot overbooking prevention

❌ Failure Handling
Database connection issues

Invalid time slots

Duplicate token creation

Slot capacity exceeded

Invalid doctor or token IDs

Network timeouts

All failures return meaningful HTTP status codes and messages.

🧮 Allocation Algorithm
Validate doctor availability

Validate time slot

Check capacity & reserved emergency slots

Apply priority rules

Assign token & estimate consultation time

Update slot counters

🔄 Reallocation Logic
Triggered on:

Cancellation

No-show

Process:

Free slot capacity

Check waiting list

Promote highest priority patient

Update estimated times

Notify next patient

🚑 Emergency Handling
Uses reserved emergency slots first

Allows controlled overflow (+1)

Assigns highest priority

Suggests alternative doctors if fully occupied
